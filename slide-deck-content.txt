    Short-lived:  3.0% of power,  tau = 10s
    Medium-lived: 2.0% of power,  tau = 100s
    Long-lived:   1.6% of power,  tau = 2000s

  One-liner: "Why you can't just turn off a reactor — heat lingers"


--- 8. SCRAM (Emergency Shutdown) ---

  rho_scram(t) = rho_max * (1 - e^(-t / tau))

  Where:
    rho_max = -8000 pcm (massive negative reactivity)
    tau     = 1.0 second (insertion time constant)

  One-liner: "Rods slam in, reactor shuts down in ~1 second"


--- 9. CONTROL ROD WORTH CURVE ---

  Worth(x) = x - sin(2*pi*x) / (2*pi)

  Integral of sin^2(pi*x) — models differential worth peaking
  at mid-core, where neutron flux is highest.

================================================================================
  SLIDE: WHAT MAKES IT REAL (EXPANDED)
================================================================================

There's much more than 5 bullet points. Here's the full list, organized
by category. Pick 8-10 that hit hardest for your audience.


--- NEUTRONICS (how the nuclear chain reaction is modeled) ---

  * 6-group delayed neutrons from Keepin et al. U-235 data
    - Not a simplified 1-group — uses the actual 6 precursor families
    - Each with distinct half-lives (0.23s to 56s) and yield fractions
    - This is what makes reactor control possible (without delayed
      neutrons, control would require microsecond response times)

  * Point kinetics with prompt + delayed terms
    - The same equations used in NRC-licensed reactor analysis codes
    - Separates prompt response (microseconds) from delayed (seconds)

  * Total delayed neutron fraction beta = 0.0065
    - THE critical safety parameter — one dollar of reactivity


--- THERMAL-HYDRAULICS (heat generation and removal) ---

  * Coupled fuel + coolant energy balance
    - Fuel heats up from fission, transfers heat to coolant
    - Coolant removes heat through steam generators
    - Two-node lumped parameter: fuel and coolant each have mass,
      specific heat, and heat transfer coefficients

  * Realistic thermal masses and heat transfer
    - 35 tonnes of UO2 fuel (c_p = 300 J/kg/K)
    - 18 tonnes of pressurized water (c_p = 5500 J/kg/K at 155 bar)
    - Fuel-coolant transfer: 25 MW/K
    - Steam generator removal: 60 MW/K (forced) / 10 MW/K (natural circ)

  * Pump trip physics
    - Losing the pump drops heat removal from 60 to 10 MW/K
    - Coolant temperature rises realistically on natural circulation
    - This is a real operational concern in PWRs


--- REACTIVITY FEEDBACK (inherent safety mechanisms) ---

  * Doppler broadening (fuel temperature feedback)
    - alpha_f = -4 pcm/K — fuel heats up, reactivity drops
    - This is the PRIMARY inherent safety mechanism in every reactor
    - Acts within milliseconds (fastest feedback)

  * Moderator temperature coefficient
    - alpha_c = -25 pcm/K — hot water absorbs fewer neutrons poorly,
      but in a PWR it moderates less, so reactivity drops
    - Stronger than Doppler but slower (coolant thermal inertia)

  * Both coefficients are NEGATIVE
    - This means the reactor is inherently self-stabilizing
    - Power up → temperatures up → reactivity down → power stabilizes
    - This is not an approximation — it's how real PWRs work


--- XENON-135 POISONING (the operator's nemesis) ---

  * Full coupled I-135 / Xe-135 dynamics
    - Not a lookup table — solves the actual differential equations
    - I-135 (6.57h half-life) decays into Xe-135 (9.14h half-life)
    - Xe-135 has a 2.6 MILLION barn absorption cross-section
      (largest of any known nuclide)

  * Equilibrium xenon worth: -2800 pcm at full power
    - That's 4.3 dollars of negative reactivity from a single isotope
    - After shutdown, xenon PEAKS before decaying (the "xenon pit")
    - This is why real reactors can't restart immediately after shutdown

  * 500x time acceleration preserving correct equilibrium
    - Real xenon dynamics take 10-40 hours
    - We speed up rates but keep the steady-state math identical
    - Students see hours of physics in minutes


--- CONTROL SYSTEMS (what operators actually manipulate) ---

  * Non-linear control rod worth (sine-squared S-curve)
    - Rods are worth more in the middle of the core
    - Matches real differential worth curves from HRTD training
    - Total worth: 3000 pcm

  * Soluble boron chemical shim
    - Boric acid dissolved in coolant: -10 pcm/ppm
    - Range: 0-2500 ppm (real PWR operating range)
    - Rate-limited to 10 ppm/s (realistic dilution/boration rates)

  * Scram: exponential reactivity insertion
    - -8000 pcm driven by gravity + springs
    - Time constant: 1 second (realistic rod drop time)
    - 300 pcm shutdown margin below critical


--- DECAY HEAT (why Fukushima happened) ---

  * 3-group fission product decay model
    - Short (10s), medium (100s), long (2000s) time constants
    - Total: 6.6% of operating power persists after shutdown
    - This is why cooling must continue even after the chain reaction stops

  * 5x time acceleration for educational visibility
    - Students can see decay heat decline in real-time


--- PROTECTION SYSTEM (automatic safety trips) ---

  * Three automatic trip setpoints:
    - Power > 110% nominal → automatic SCRAM
    - Fuel temperature > 1800K → automatic SCRAM
    - Coolant temperature > 620K → automatic SCRAM

  * Alarm engine with deadband hysteresis
    - Prevents alarm chattering near threshold
    - Priority-sorted: Critical > High > Medium > Low
    - Alarm lifecycle: activate → acknowledge → clear


--- NUMERICAL METHODS (why the physics actually works) ---

  * 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration
    - 4 derivative evaluations per timestep
    - Handles stiff kinetics equations (prompt jump)
    - 10ms timestep at 100 Hz via requestAnimationFrame

  * Full state validation and safety clamping
    - Every input validated (finite, in-range, physically sensible)
    - State clamped to physical bounds every step
    - Prevents numerical blowup from ever reaching the UI

  * Rate-limited controls
    - Rod movement: max 5%/second
    - Boron changes: max 10 ppm/second
    - Prevents unphysical instantaneous jumps


--- WHAT WE DELIBERATELY SIMPLIFIED (good slide for Q&A) ---

  * Point kinetics, not spatial (no flux shape)
  * Lumped parameter thermal (2-node, not finite element)
  * Prompt generation time slowed 10x for human interaction
  * No fuel burnup or depletion
  * Simplified pressure model
  * These are standard educational simplifications used in
    NRC HRTD training simulators
